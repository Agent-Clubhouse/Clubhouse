# Projects

A **project** in Clubhouse represents a folder on your machine, typically a Git repository.

## Adding a Project

Click the `+` button in the Project Rail to add a new project. You'll be prompted to select a folder. Clubhouse will automatically detect:

- The project name (from the folder name)
- Git configuration (branch, remotes, etc.)

## Project Settings

Each project has its own settings, accessible from the Settings panel with the project selected:

- **Display name** — Override the default folder name
- **Color** — Choose an accent color for the project icon
- **Icon** — Upload a custom icon image
- **Orchestrator** — Select which AI backend to use

## Removing a Project

Projects can be removed from Clubhouse without affecting the files on disk. Navigate to project settings and use the remove option.

## Multiple Projects

You can have multiple projects open simultaneously. Each project maintains its own:

- Set of durable and quick agents
- Plugin configurations
- Git state and worktrees
