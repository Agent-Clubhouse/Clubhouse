# Dashboard

The Dashboard is your home screen — a bird's-eye view of all projects and agent activity.

## Overview Cards

Four stat cards at the top summarize your workspace:

| Card | Shows |
|------|-------|
| **Projects** | Total registered projects |
| **Working** | Agents currently running |
| **Attention** | Agents needing permission approval or in error state |
| **Done Today** | Quick agents completed since midnight |

## Needs Attention

A highlighted section lists agents that require action (permission requests, errors). Click any entry to jump directly to that agent.

## Project Cards

Each project displays:
- Status pills showing agent counts by state (working, idle, errored, sleeping)
- Quick-action buttons for Hub and Settings
- Durable agent list with current branch and status
- Quick agent completion count

## Recent Activity

Shows up to 8 recently completed quick agents across all projects:
- Status (success/failed/cancelled), agent name, project
- Duration and cost (USD)
- Click to review the full summary

## Accessing the Dashboard

- Click the **Home** icon in the Project Rail
- Press `Cmd+Shift+H`
- Toggle Dashboard visibility in **Settings > Display**
