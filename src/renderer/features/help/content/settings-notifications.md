# Notifications & Badges

Stay informed about agent activity even when Clubhouse is in the background.

## Notification Settings

**Settings > Notifications**

### Master Toggle

Disables all system notifications when off. Badge indicators within the app may still appear.

### Event Notifications

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Permission Request** | Agent waiting for approval — keep this enabled to avoid stalling agents |
| **Agent Stopped** | Agent finished or exited |
| **Agent Idle** | Agent idle for an extended period — may be stuck |
| **Agent Error** | Agent crashed unexpectedly |

Each event can be toggled independently.

### macOS Permissions

If notifications aren't appearing: **System Settings > Notifications > Clubhouse**. Use the **Test Notification** button in Clubhouse settings to verify.

## Badges

Badges are indicator dots/counts on icons and tabs signaling pending items.

| Setting | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| **Plugin badges** | Show/hide badges from all plugins |
| **Project Rail badges** | Show/hide aggregate badges on project icons |
| **Per-project overrides** | Customize badge behavior per project (right-click project icon) |
| **Clear All Badges** | Reset all badges across projects and plugins |

## Dock Badge

The macOS Dock icon shows a count of pending items (e.g., permission requests). Updates in real time, clears when addressed.

## Sound

Notification sounds are configured separately in **Settings > Sound**. See the **Sound & Audio** help topic.
