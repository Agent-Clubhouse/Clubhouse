# Hub & Workspaces

The Hub is a split-pane workspace for monitoring multiple agents side-by-side. Use it to watch several agents work simultaneously without switching tabs.

## Two Modes

| Mode | Scope | Access |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Per-Project Hub** | Shows agents from one project | Explorer Rail tab within a project |
| **Cross-Project Hub** | Spans all projects | Project Rail icon (enable in **Settings > Display**) |

## Working with Panes

Each pane displays one agent's terminal. You can:

- **Split** — Hover over pane edges to reveal split arrows (up/down/left/right)
- **Assign an agent** — Select from the dropdown picker or drag an agent into a pane
- **Swap** — Drag pane name chips to rearrange
- **Zoom** — Maximize a single pane to full view; click again to restore
- **Resize** — Drag dividers between panes
- **Close** — Remove a pane (minimum 1 always remains)

## Multiple Hub Tabs

- Click `+` to create additional hub tabs within a workspace
- Double-click a tab name to rename it
- Click `x` on a tab to remove it

## Pop-Out Windows

Detach any hub tab or individual agent into a separate OS window:

- **Hub pop-out:** Hover over a hub tab and click the pop-out icon
- **Agent pop-out:** Use the pane menu or context menu on an agent

Pop-out windows stay fully synchronized with the main window — changes in either are reflected in both. Useful for multi-monitor setups.

## Layout Persistence

Hub layouts save automatically and restore across app restarts.

> **Example workflow:** Create a 2x2 hub grid with your 4 active agents. Pop it out to a second monitor. Continue working in the main window while monitoring all agents at a glance.
